PBLS: Polynomial Box Least Squares

Detecting small transits in stellar light curves dominated by spot-induced
variability remains challenging for current algorithms, especially when
individual transit events have low signal-to-noise ratios (S/N ~ a few).
Existing state-of-the-art methods often fail to reliably improve detection
significance with increasing transit numbers, leaving gaps in our knowledge of
small, young exoplanets.  To address this, we require an algorithm whose
detection statistic consistently and robustly improves as the square root of the
number of observed transits.
